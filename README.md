# Sector DCC Garch Model
This folder has a R script that will generate a DCC Garch model from historical Sector ETF Data. This is a portion of the code that drove my final project in my Financial Econometrics class at the University of Alabama. The DCC Garch model was created by Robert Engle (see citation below). There were promising applying the model to these assets but I would like to improve it. I plan to update this by building out a neural stochastic volatility model and plug those predictions into portfolio optimization. Can share the results and other code from my final project upon request.
